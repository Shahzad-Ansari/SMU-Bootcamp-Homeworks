1) from the data it is clear that a majority of purchases are made by male clients at about 84 percent,
we could explore why this is the case and attempt to expand the market from this or we could find that 
majority of the players in this MMORPG are male players 

2) Most purchases are made by those in the age range of 20 to 24, forming the peak of a bell curve. From this 
additional data we can surmise that this game has a large amount of male players from the age range of mid teens
to late 20s

the top 5 items only account for 9% of all sales. We can use this infromation to make the assumption that the sales
accross all items are generally well spread out.
